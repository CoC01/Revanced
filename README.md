They are open-source scripts for patching various apps like YouTube, YouTube Music... However, they are very difficult to use for most users. That's why I created this repository to provide an easier way.

## ⚙️ How this repository work?<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cBlTGBt.png" align="right" />
Simply, all you need to do is choose the app you want to use from the options below: 'Revanced' or 'Revanced Extended'. Then, select your phone's CPU architecture. If you don't know what your phone's CPU architecture is, choose All Architectures. That's all there is to it.

If you want to use the YouTube or YouTube Music app, you need to download and install MicroG or mMircoG. I recommend using MicroG because mMircoG is still in beta.

All the code is open-source, clearly, and the APK files used for patching are downloaded from a trusted site, so it is totally safe for you to use.
